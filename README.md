# Custom_Scraper
Just a Custom Web Scraper

This is a custom web scraper that I made using Selenium with Python. I chose Cricket stats for my scraping project and I used the ESPN website \
to get cricket stats of Team India for the past 10 years.
I created a new csv file to store the data that I got from scraping the website.
